# The Veg-Curious Guide

Are you slowly but surely noticing that your friends or family members are not eating meat and wondering what hippy juice everyone is drinking? Are you depressed and denying the news that [bacon is bad for you](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/03/report-says-eating-processed-meat-is-carcinogenic-understanding-the-findings/) and [Arnold Schwarzenegger is telling you to eat more plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHSkahIFDF4)? Are you interested in learning about a plant-based diet, but you're not sure where to start? If so, you may be what we like to call *veg-curious* and this guide was made for you. 

We've outlined basic starter lists that will help you get started researching the benefits of a whole-foods, plant-based diet. What are the must-see documentaries? What cookbooks are great for home chefs who are new to vegan cooking? In our experience, personal transformation happens when we do our own research and make up our own minds. Hopefully this guide helps you kick-start your own research, as these resources made a huge impact on our lives. 

We are an ordinary couple, Ben and Maggie Griner, with a passion for living well, and a natural talent for thorough research. By day, Maggie is a web designer and Ben is a software developer. By night we can be found obsessively researching plant-based living, exploring at the farmer's market, or experimenting in the kitchen.
