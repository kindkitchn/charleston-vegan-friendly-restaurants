# Non-toxic Cleaning

**Documentaries to Watch**
* [The Human Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYgb9gUbINk) | A documentary that "lifts the veil on the shocking reality that thousands of untested chemicals are in our everyday products, our homes and inside of us".

**Resources**
* The Environment Working Group | [ewg.org](ewg.org). They have a helpful database that allows you to search for products and view its ingredients. EWG.org gives you an overall health rating for each product, as well as a rating for each ingredient in the product. 
* Another resource that looks really helpful is [goodguide.org](http://www.goodguide.com/).

Below are a few examples of products we *were* using and replaced with natural alternatives.

### Example Swap: Laundry Detergent 
My husband was using the Arm and Hammer Plus Oxi Clean Liquid Laundry Detergent, which received an "F" on ewg.org, citing concern for asthma/respiratory, skin Allergies & irritation, developmental & reproductive toxicity issues and a high concern for causing cancer ([view details on ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/158-ArmHammerPlusOxiCleanLiquidDetergentHECoolBreeze)).

Our new laundry detergent: [Whole Foods 365 Everyday Value 2X Concentrated Laundry Detergent, Unscented](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/5720-WholeFoods365EverydayValue2XConcentratedLaundryDetergentUnscented) ([view details on ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/5720-WholeFoods365EverydayValue2XConcentratedLaundryDetergentUnscented))

### Other products we owned with terrible ratings
Crest Pro Health Anticavity Flouride Rinse:
PROPYLPARABEN is a 7 (high hazard) Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Ecotoxicology, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, use restrictions ([view details on ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/538073/Crest_Pro-Health_Anti-Cavity_Fluoride_Rinse_Complete_Clean_Mint/)).

Probably the most concerning product that we owned was Goo Gone ([view details on ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/2882-GooGoneSprayGelCitrusPower)). Next time I need a Goo Gone alternative, I will try coconut oil, baking soda and oil as referenced [in this article on diynatural.com](http://www.diynatural.com/adhesive-remover-homemade-goo-gone/).
