###Pack a cooler as your second carry-on
Most airlines allow one carry-on and a "small bag" and you can bring any food that is not liquid on the plane. I recently purchased an [Igloo Duo 20 Can Capacity Newport Dual Compartment Tote](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006DUYC0U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) which worked perfectly as a laptop bag and a cooler. You can also add [gel ice packs ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XL4PVTW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1ORBFWKAM3Q7B) to your cooler. I also have this [cooler tote](http://www.amazon.com/Canvas-Picnic-Insulated-Cooler-Travel/dp/B00XMHVZ9I/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&qid=1436578100&sr=8-27&keywords=small+cooler+bag). It still has a pouch for your phone and wallet and it just looks like you are carrying a nice bag.
