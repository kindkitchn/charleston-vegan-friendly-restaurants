### Meet Maggie Griner

My love for quality ingredients began in college when my favorite stress relieving activity became spending time in grocery stores and farmerâ€™s markets. I was a member of the University of Alabama Women's Golf team and a busy public relations student. Through a demanding schedule, cooking became my outlet for relaxation and by minoring in nutrition, I learned how to detox and destress with healthy food. 

Since college, my interest in researching nutrition and cooking has become more and more a meaningful part of my life. Recently, I've come to understand that I am a proud introvert, thanks to Susan Cain and her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. When I am more conscious of my food choices, I can better protect my energy in a world where recharge time can be scarce. 

Another motivation that inspires my interest in nutrition is my motivation to feel great now and protect a healthy future for those I love. The more I learn about nutrition, the more I realize that if we aren't consciously choosing healthier options, the options that show up on our laps are toxic and inflammatory, leading to many diseases and terrible symptoms. I am amazed and inspired by how a plant-passionate diet and lifestyle can not only prevent and reverse disease, but create a life of health, vitality and well-being. Kind Kitchn will be a space where I can share this information more often with my family, friends and you! The books that have had the biggest influence on me lately are Crazy Sexy Diet by Kris Carr and Radical Remission by Dr. Kelly Turner. Check them out! 

Alongside my love for food, I have also spent the last 10 years enjoying my career as a web designer. I am currently working for Lullabot as a User Experience Designer. Our company is 100% distributed, meaning that every person in the company lives in a different city and works from home (or a coffee shop, or wherever). Working for a distributed company has also helped fuel my ability to invest time in my nutrition research.

I truly enjoy digital marketing and I'm inspired by the positive power of digital content for spreading positivity and love. I am so excited to begin blending my passion for designing digital content with my love for kind ingredients through Kind Kitchn.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect. I live in Charleston, South Carolina with the love of my life and my husband, Ben Griner.
