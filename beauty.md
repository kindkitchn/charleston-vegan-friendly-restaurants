### Natural body wash and hand wash

* 1 cup Liquid castille soap

* Optional: 
  * 25-50 drops Essential Oils of your choice (if you are unsure Lavender, Geranium, Ylang-Ylang, and Neroli are suitable for all skin types)
  * 1/4 cup raw organic honey

Shampoo v1
½ cup of coconut milk
½ cup of castille soap
1 TB vitamin E
1 TSP fenugreek powder
20 drops lav 10 drops rosemary
*Tried a ACV rinse and this shampoo, still very oily
*Tried castille soap only to get rid of oil, stlil oily 

Shampoo v2
1 tablespoon green clay
1 tablespoon liquid castile soap
2 teaspoons strongly brewed green tea
10 drops tea tree oil
*Used conditioner on top
*Still very oily

Shampoo v3
1 part peppermint castille soap

This was the best blend so far, everything was good except difficult to comb through 

Ultimately, still using shampoo and conditioner. Using this brand: [Beautiful Curls](http://beautifulcurls.com/)

### Sea Salt Hair Spritz
* 2 parts rose water
* 5-6 drops tea tree oil (any essential oil would be great here)
* 1 teaspoon of sea salt (I use [this brand](http://www.amazon.com/Neti-Pot-Infused-French-Atlantic/dp/B00599XUN6) in my bathroom, try it mixed with toothpaste for extra fresh breath and teeth whitening)

### Facial cleansing oil
* A bottle of any size. (I currently use 100mL amber glass bottles)
* Organic sweet almond oil
* Essential oils of your choice (optional)

Mix 2/3 part of the Sweet Almond Oil and 1/3 part Castor Oil in your bottle of choice.
Ensure the oils are blended well.

### Face scrub
1 jar (approx. 100mL capacity)
3 tblsp of Organic Ground Coffee Beans
1 tblsp of Organic Coconut Oil
1 tblsp of Raw Honey
(optional) a few drops of essential oils

### ACV Toner
A bottle of your choice
(I use a 100mL amber bottle with a spray nozzle)
Organic Apple Cider Vinegar
Filtered Water
Tea Tree Oil / or Essential Oils of your choice

Fill your bottle with 1/4 parts ACV, and 3/4 parts filtered water.
Add around 10-20 drops of tea tree oil, or others oils of your choice. Sweet orange makes for a really nice refreshing toner. 


### Ideas I would like to try
* Alkaline water filter on shower
* Lemon Hairspray
